## Description
Space Lab 51 is a tactical sci-fi RPG developed for the PSITE Region III
game development competition in the Philippines, where it won the 1st place.

The game was developed in Java and LWJGL. The map of the game was made using [Mithril Pants Map Editor]()
It was made in a few days therefore a lot of code is not optimized and
not so good practice.
